We think coding is cool. The perception of it within the general public is still outdated. We want to update the image of a stereotypical coder and inspire young people to start coding by developing more coding skills at Project code X by also working on the real projects as Mr Andre said.In fact we could say not everybody should become a coder, but we would like to inspire as many as possible to give it a go.We have dreams to build something out of nothing,more specialy on developing to explore new ideas of managing businesses with technology devices included and our quallifications.
